Analysis of the recent article 'Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes' by Phoebe M. R. DeVries, Fernanda Viégas, Martin Wattenberg & Brendan J. Meade, published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) in 2018.

This repo includes, chronologically:

(1a) notebook folder related to my January 2019 Coursera/IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone project: **Aftershock pattern prediction based on earthquake rupture data for improved seismic hazard assessment**

(1b) dataset folder and srcmod2.py used in (1a).

(2) ref_Mignan&Broccardo_IWANN2019.pdf, the article **A Deeper Look into ‘Deep Learning
of Aftershock Patterns Following Large Earthquakes’: Illustrating First Principles in Neural Network Physical Interpretability** published in [Advances in Computational Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) and presented at the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN19) in June 2019. This paper results from (1);

(4) [ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01983) **One neuron is more informative than a deep neural network for aftershock pattern forecasting** where we go one step further in the analysis, showing that a logistic regression (one neuron) performs as well as, if not better than any more complex neural network.


NB: in (1), in case GitHub cannot load a notebook, use instead https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amignan/pred_seism_aftXYZ/blob/master/notebooks/NOTEBOOK_NAME.ipynb

This is for example the case for notebooks containing animations:
